Authentication
==============

Authentication in the Zenya API is handled using Basic HTTP Authentication (:rfc:`2617`) over 
an ssl-secured connection. Please contact Zenya directly for login credentials. The HTTP 
Authorization header (:rfc:`2616#section-14.8`) should be included with each request to the Zenya API.

All calls described in the following documentation assume that you include the proper
authentication with each call.
