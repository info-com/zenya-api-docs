Authentication
==============

Authentication in the eContext API is handled using Basic HTTP Authentication (:rfc:`2617`) over
an SSL secured connection. Please contact eContext directly for login credentials. The HTTP
Authorization header (:rfc:`2616#section-14.8`) should be included with each request to the eContext API.

All calls described in the following documentation assume that you include the proper
authentication with each call.
