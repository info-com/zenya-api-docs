However, they have come up with a way to offer you an Xbox One for $399.</p><p>From now until March 2, Microsoft Stores will offer you $100 of store credit if you trade in a PS3, Xbox 360 S, or Xbox 360 E. Of course, there’s a number of terms and conditions in order to get that $100. The console must be in fully working order and have its original accessories including the power supply. You will also only be guaranteed to get $100 for your old machine if you agree to purchase an Xbox One at the same time.</p></body></html>"
